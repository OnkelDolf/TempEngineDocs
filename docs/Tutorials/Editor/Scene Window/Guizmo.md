# Guizmo

In the Scene window you can change the guizmo modes (translate, rotate, scale) in two ways.

The first way is to use the guizmo modes window found att the left side of the scene window.
The modes are as followed:

1. Translate (move)
2. Rotate
3. Scale
4. Bound scaling

The second way to change the modes are using the keyboard shortcuts.
While not holding the right mouse button you can use:

- W - Translate
- E - Rotate
- R - Scale
- T - Bound scaling

Note that you must have atleast one object selected to be able to use the keyboard shortcuts.
