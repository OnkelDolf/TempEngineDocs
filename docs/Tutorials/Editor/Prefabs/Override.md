# Overriding A Prefab

To override a prefab use the override button in the inspector after selecting the prefab.

After it will ask if you are sure you want to override.
If the override fails you will get a window saying it failed.
When it fails try once more, if it keeps failing try making a new identical prefab.
Last resort ask help.
